## What?
CRYPT is a tool that allows you to apply different functions on texts; Now with a GUI.

## Why?
Because I wanted to learn creating GUI programs. Also, the GUI uses tabs which is more neat.

## What functions are implemented?
1. Encodings:
   - Base16
   - Base32
   - Base64
   - Base85

2. Ciphers:
   - Caesar Cipher
   - Morse Code
   - Baconian Cipher
   - Vigen√®re Cipher

3. Hashes:
   - MD5 & MD5 Crypt
   - SHA256 & SHA512
   - SHA256 & SHA512 Crypt
   - NThash
   - BCrypt
   - Argon2
   - PBKDF2+SHA256 & PBKDF2+SHA512
   - Hash Cracking with a wordlist or by Bruteforcing

## Installation
1. Install Python3
2. Clone this git repository OR Download source code from Releases page
3. Unpack the zip or tar
4. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment and use that:
    ```shell
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
    On Mac/Linux:
    ```shell
    source ./venv/bin/activate
    ```
    On Windows
    ```shell
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
5. install the libraries in `requirements.txt` using:
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Note: This app uses `pyperclip` for copy/paste functions.
1. On Windows, no additional modules are needed.
2. On Mac, this module makes use of the `pbcopy` and `pbpaste` commands, which should come with the os.
3. On Linux, this module makes use of the `xclip` or `xsel` commands, which should come with the os. Otherwise install `xclip` (X11), `wl-clipboard` (Wayland) or `xsel` packages using OS's package manager (Like apt, yum, ...) (Note: xsel does not always seem to work.)
For more information visit [pyperclip repository].

```shell
